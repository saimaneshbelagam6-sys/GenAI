## Use Case 2 - Legacy Code conversion



##### ***Use Case Summary:***



Customer a financial service company, who is planning to modernize their legacy application to moder Java, Python services. However, there is no documentation available, nor any tool available to convert this. The entire process requires manual effort in understanding voluminous code, understanding requirements with business users and the rewriting in modern technology. This makes entire conversion not-feasible.



##### 

##### ***Input code:***



Legacy application in VB, Cobol, Java generated synthetically using LLM.





##### ***What to be built:***



1\. Create documentation of the code. Document should include the components and processing logic which would be adequate to understand the overall code behaviour and can be used to create code in target technology

2\. Automated correctness evaluation and refinement of generated documentation to reduce manual review effort. Final evaluation report for the documentation should be available as a dashboard indicating the areas to be manually cross checked

3\. Create code in target technology and architecture incorporating the same features as in source. Code should be runnable in target architecture

4\. Create unit test cases
